T2 -- Acknowledgements

    Thanks go out to our Instructor, Teaching Assistants & Tutors for guidance & clarity 
    for bringing this project where it is today. Your patience was very much appreciated 
    during these past 2 weeks of questions, comments & ideas shared.

T3 -- Functionality

    When you first visit the site, there will be a log-in/sign-up link on the top right corner where you can 
    create a profile & save your creations should you choose to do so. You can also click on the button 
    "Get To The Memes" to get started with said creations. Meme Generator link on the top left corner takes 
    you back to home page.

T4 -- Log-In/Sign-Up

    Since this is your first visit to website, when you click on Log-In/Sign-Up link, it will take 
    you to a form for you to fill out. It requires a first name, last name, email address & password 
    (password requirements are that it has to be at least six(6) characters long). Once you input 
    credentials of your choice, your profile will be created. When next you visit again, you can 
    click on Log-In link located on left side of screen with your email address & password, then 
    click the button "Submit".

T5 -- Meme Creation

    Once you click on the button "Get To The Memes", you will be shown a form labeled "Top Text Here" & 
    "Bottom text Here" at the top of the screen where you can type what you want & where it will appear on. 
    Below that is the button "Next Image" where it will generate another image should the current one 
    be not to your liking. Below that is the button "Download" where once your creation is complete you 
    can save it wherever you please (Under Construction at the moment, so for now workaround 
    would be to take a screenshot). On the middle of the screen is where the image will appear once you 
    click on the button "Next Image".
