T2 -- Acknowledgements

    Thanks go out to our Instructor, Teaching Assistants & Tutors for guidance & clarity 
    for bringing this project where it is today. Your patience was very much appreciated 
    during these past 2 weeks of questions, comments & ideas shared.

T3 -- Functionality

    When you first visit the site, there will be a log-in & sign-up links on the top right 
    corner where you can create a profile & save your creations should you choose to do so. 
    You can also click on the button "Get To The Memes" to get started with said creations. 
    Meme Generator link on the top left corner takes you back to home page.

T4 -- Log-In/Sign-Up

    Since this is your first visit to website, when you click on Sign-Up link, it will take 
    you to a form for you to fill out. It requires a first name, last name, email address & password 
    (password requirements are that it has to be at least six(6) characters long). Once you input 
    credentials of your choice, your profile will be created. When next you visit again, you can 
    click on Log-In link with your email address & password, then click the button "Submit".

T5 -- Meme Creation

    Once you click on the button "Get To The Memes", you will be shown a form labeled "Top Text Here",
    "Middle Text Here & "Bottom Text Here" at the top of the screen where you can type what you want 
    & where it will appear on. Once you are done typing in what you would want shown, you can drag 
    text anywhere you please. Below forms is the button "Next Image" where it will generate another 
    image should the current one be not to your liking. Below that is the button "Download" where 
    once your creation is complete you can save it wherever you please. On the middle of the screen 
    is where the image will appear once you click on the button "Next Image". There is also a gallery
    for starters to get you inspired with your own creative memes.

T6 -- Final Thoughts

   We hope that you enjoy exploring this humble site of ours & that it brightened up your day a little.

   And now a note from a wayward soul in CrossCode as a reminder for when life gets on the hectic side.
